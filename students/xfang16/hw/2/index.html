		Build an HTML5 page that describes two or more places you have lived or visited other
		than Vancouver BC (cities, countries, any locales of your choice). Include text and
		images to inform the user about each place. At minimum, use one image and several
		sentences to describe each place. You may use images that you find online, but the
		textual content should be authored by you. Describe what you liked or did not like
		about the place, and some useful or interesting information you know (eg: where your
		favorite restaurant is).
		Use at least 5 different elements unique to HTML5, be sure all page content is
		semantically marked up.
		Using any resources available to you, investigate two new HTML5 elements or features
		not demonstrated in class. Use these elements on the page. Include on this page the
		following information about each of the two new HTML tags:
		1. Descriptions of the semantics/rules of use (eg: parent/child relationships)
		2. A list of relevant attributes and details about how to use each attribute
		3. Browser compatibility issues (if any) for this element across IE, Firefox,
		Chrome, Safari, and/or Opera.
		4. Any additional notes you deem relevent

					<h2>Introduction to Toronto, Canada</h2>

						<p>I have lived in Toronto for 5 years during my studies in University of Toronto. It's a pretty big city in Toronto and there are lots of things that I liked and disliked. I loved how there is many place to visit in Toronto downtown such as its distillery district and different cultural towns including Little Italy, Little Portugal and China Town. There is also a very diverse multiculturalism in Toronto where you will see people from many more areas than Vancouver, especially people from the Middle East. On the other hand, the winter of Toronto is not someone whose origin is Vancouver would like - getting -20&deg;C as lowest temperature would not be uncommon in Toronto. Personally for me, the lack of seafood and Japanese food compared to Vancouver is also a setback for me that caused me to eventually move back to Vancouver.</p><br />
						<p>An interesting fact about Toronto - do you know that Yonge Street was once considered to be the longest street in the world? (Not anymore but it's long!) It starts at Queenâ€™s Quay and ends at a farm access lane west of Keswick for a total length of 86km.</p>

					<h2>Introduction to Tokyo, Japan</h2>

					<div class="content-wrapper">
						<p>I have been to Tokyo for a total of 3 times during my 3 visits to Japan. It is the biggest city in Japan and it's certainly an exciting city to visit with its size and fast pace. I like the fact that Tokyo accomidates tourists very well and has famous attractions such as the Asakusa shrine and Gundam robot at Odaiba area that most tourists visit. Also, food tastes better and is cheaper than many Japanese restaurants in Canada, and public transit as well as access to convenient store and 24 hour restaurants are much better. However, as a metropolis, Tokyo certainly has its share of downsides - crowded trains and subway stations, long line-ups to restaurants and stores, and the amount of squeezing you would have to do as a participant of a popular event is almost unbearable. If you are claustrophobic you would certainly have a hard time there!</p><br />
						<p>If you ever visit Tokyo I definitely recommend you to try the conveyor belt sushi. It's cheap and delicious sushi served on a moving belt and it would be an interesting experience for someone who never had sushi in this fashion!</p>

					<h2>2 new HTML5 features not covered in class</h2>
					<h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_contenteditable.asp" target="_blank">Editable content attribute</a></h3>
					<p>The "contenteditable" attribute is a new HTML5 global attriibute that specifies whether the content of an element is editable or not depends on it being set to true or false. See supported browsers from title link, and see example below for usage:</p><br />
					<p class="editable-content" contenteditable="true">Example: TRY EDIT ME!</p>
					<h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_mark.asp" target="_blank">Mark html tag</a></h3>
					<p>The &lt;mark&gt; tag is a new tag in HTML5 that highlights your text (p and h# tags) with yellow background. Before HTML5 developers would have to define a custom color text and background attribute to achieve this effect. See supported browsers from title link, and see example below for usage:</p><br />
					<p>Example: <mark>I am highlighted mark text.</mark></p>
