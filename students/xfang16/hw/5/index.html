					<blockquote>"League of Legends is the world’s most popular MOBA, boasting 67 million players monthly and up to 30 million players each and every day across its global servers it is disputably the most popular game in existence. In this MOBA, you play as one of [138] characters (referred to as Champions) in teams of five fighting others in a race down their lanes to destroy the enemy base first. Ideally, teams will send one player to the top lane, one to the middle lane, two into the bottom lane and the fifth one will take the jungle that separates these lanes. Every lane will fight individually while receiving aid from their jungler until it becomes time for 5 on 5 team fights!  Since the game stems from the ideals of World of Warcraft and other online games before it, there are diverse sets of roles and characters who fulfill them. What’s your play style? Are you a support, acting as a medic for the easy-to-kill champions? Or maybe “No guts, no glory” is your anthem and prefer to get right up in the face of your enemies with a Tank or Bruiser!  However you play your games, League of Legends has something to suit you." - Twinfinite Staff</blockquote>

				<h2>My Reviews - Why I recommend this game</h2>

					<p>I have played this game many years since high school and the best thing about this game is that the game never gets old! Content updates are constantly implemented and old champions are revisited if necessary to adjust how strong they are relative to other champions as well as adding new skills to the champion (so a old dog can learn many new tricks!). When you start a game, it also feels new because you start as a level 1 character every game and play with different players from the last one. You can feel the progression of the game as your character becomes stronger and eventually obtain an ultimate skill (at level 6) that you can unleash upon your enemy. My favourite type of champion to play is mage, which relies on spells or skills to deal tons of damage to opponent and erase them from the game! It is really fun and I really recommend anyone new to the game to try variety of styles and figure out which champion is the one for you.</p>
