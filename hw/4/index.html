		Create one layout that is demonstrated across three pages for your web space. Be sure
		your homepage from Homework#1 includes an easy to find link for finding one of these
		new pages. These pages may not use any of the previous layouts or styles from your
		earlier comp1950 work.
		Technical requirements
		- The pages must be free of structural errors. x
		- Use a CSS Reset to set a standard for the various browser defaults (choose
		from any available CSS resets, and you may modify it if you wish) x
		- Build an appealing, usable layout using external CSS (no tables for layout). The
		configuration of the layout is otherwise up to you (2/3/4 column, fixed/variable
		width, etc, etc). Build it on your own, donâ€™t copy-paste online CSS templates,
		but you may use them as a guide for your own code. Be sure your layout can
		handle different quantities of content. x
		- Your layout should include multiple icon images (eg: social media, navigation
		icons, etc, your choice). Search online for premade icons you can use. Use a
		single sprite image for all icon images. x
		- Populate each page with generic lorum ipsum content. Be sure to include
		examples of various headings, paragraphs, and hyperlinks. Demonstrate that
		your layout is flexible by including varying quantities of content on each of the
		three pages. x
		- Include a well styled HTML list navigation that allows the user to browse all
		three pages of this homework. The other hyperlinks do not have to link to
		actual pages. x
		- All content must be styled with effective colors and fonts. All links must be
		pseudoclassed. x

				<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
				<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
