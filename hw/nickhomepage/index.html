				<h2>New York City</h2>

						<article>
							<h3>"The Center of the Universe"</h3>
							<p>The Big Apple. Gotham. The City That Never Sleeps (or is that Las Vegas?)<br>
							The world starts and ends in New York City - or at least that's what the locals<br>
							would like to think. If you've never been here before, you've seen it in every other<br>
							Hollywood movie or TV show. Come for Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State <br>
							Building and literally hundreds of other famous attractions - like Rockefeller Center,<br>
							my favorite. Stay for the ethnic and culinary diversity, and try to avoid the sky high <br>
							rent, incessant traffic and mass of pedestrians.</p>

				<h2>London</h2>
					<article>
							<h3>"The Big Smoke"</h3>
							<p>London is the other Center of the Universe, and at the British Empire's height<br>
							it was literally the world's capital. The top draws are the Tower of London, Big Ben,<br>
							the London Eye and Buckingham Palace, but you literally can't walk down a single street<br>
							of the city without passing some landmark or birthplace of some historical figure. London <br>
							is probably the most famous and historic city in the world and its attractions are too numerous<br>
							to list. It's also one of the most expensive cities in the world too, which is really the only bad<br>
							thing I would say about it.</p>

							<h3>Two New HTML5 Elements</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>HR Tag</li>
									<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp">HR Tag</a></p>
									<p>The horizontal line tag is a simple self contained block tag that inserts a basic horizontal line <br>
									at a specific point in the page. There are no compatibility issues with any of the major browsers.</p>
								<li>Details Tag</li>
									<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp">Details Tag</a></p>
									<p>The details tag is an interactive feature that specifies any content that the user can view or hide<br>
									on demand. It's fully compatible on the newest versions of all major browsers with the exception of<br>
									Internet Explorer.</p>
