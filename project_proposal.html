	      <h2 id="prop">Proposal Theme</h2>
				<p>The theme of the project will be a blog style website that introduces authentic Japanese food. It will include several types of food commonly found in Japan as well as its characteristics, where you can find them, price, pictures, links to other sites about the food, etc. The website will be initially divided into big categories as main headings, then in each heading, with separate pages, specific food that belongs to its corresponding category will be discussed.</p><br />
	      <h2 id="aud">Audience Analysis</h2>
				<p>The target audience will be foodies as well as people who are specifically interested in Japanese culture and cuisine. They may or may not have prior knowledge about Japanese food, but the site will try to educate to both the experienced and the beginners about food beyond sushi and ramen which are currently popular. This site may also serve the needs of tourists who are planning to visit Japan but are not sure what to eat there or what to order at a specific style of restaurant (family restaurant, pub, sushi restaurant, etc.).</p><br />
